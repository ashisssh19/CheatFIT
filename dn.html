          The Ingredients :<br>
          
          Self rising flour– A flour blend that already contains salt and a raising agent (baking powder).<br> Skip the
          expensive pre-packaged kind and make your own. If you choose to keep these donuts gluten free, use a tried and
          tested brand, like Dove Farms gluten free self rising flour.<br>
          Maple syrup– Adds sweetness and helps hold the donuts together. You can substitute this for agave nectar.<br>
          Coconut oil– Measured in its melted state. Use refined coconut oil to ensure there is no coconut flavor
          whatsoever.<br>
          Milk of choice– I used unsweetened coconut milk, but almond, soy, oat, etc. can all be used.<br>
          Chocolate frosting– Homemade 2 ingredient chocolate frosting. Make the frosting fresh so it will be still in a
          mostly liquid state, making it perfect to dip the donuts in!<br>
        
        <p>The Instructions :<br></p>
        <p> Step 1 :<br>Preheat the oven to 175C/350F. Lightly grease a 12-count donut pan (or 2 6-count pans) and set it
          aside.<br></p>
        <p>Step 2 :<br>In a large mixing bowl, add your sifted self-rising flour. Slowly add your coconut oil, maple syrup,
          and coconut milk and mix very well, until a thick batter remains.<br></p>
        <p> Step 3 :<br>Scoop out the batter in the greased donut pan(s). Lightly wet your hands and form the dough into a
          donut shape. Bake for 13-17 minutes (mine needed around 15) or until the donuts have risen and a skewer comes
          out clean.<br></p>
        <p> Step 4 :<br>Allow cooling in the donut pan for 5 minutes, before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.<br></p>
        <p>Step 5 :<br>Once cool, dip each donut in the chocolate frosting. Allow frosting to set in the refrigerator, to
          firm up.<br></p>
