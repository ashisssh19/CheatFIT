          These granola bars are perfect for anyone who loves chocolate! They’re soft and chewy, and they have a really
          rich flavor, yet not too sweet and similar to 72% dark chocolate. These granola bar bites are perfect for
          breakfasts, snacks, or any time you’re craving chocolate! They’ll keep for at least one week if stored in an
          airtight container in the refrigerator.
