           The Ingredients  :<br></p>
<p> For the dough :<br>

3 cups whole wheat flour regular or white whole wheat, or a mix<br>
2 ½ teaspoons active yeast<br>
1 ¼ cups warm water<br>
1 teaspoon salt<br>
2 tablespoons olive oil<br>
2 teaspoons honey<br>
1 tablespoon wheat gluten optional, but recommended<br></p>

<p>For the sauce :<br>

1 14-ounce can tomato sauce<br>
½ teaspoon dried oregano<br>
1 clove garlic, grated or a pinch of garlic powder<br></p>

<p>Topping ideas :<br>

Shredded Mozzarella<br>
Grated Parmesan<br>
Fresh veggies like bell peppers, onions, mushrooms, broccoli, or spinach<br>
           </p>
           <p>
           The Instructions :<br></p>
<p>Step 1 :<br>In a small bowl, whisk together warm water and yeast, and set aside. The mixture should start to foam after a few minutes.<br></p>
<p>Step 2 :<br>In a large mixing bowl, combine flour, salt, and gluten if using. Stir well, then add the water/yeast mixture, olive oil and honey. Stir until a ball forms.<br></p>
<p>Step 3 :<br>Use your hands to knead the dough for several minutes. (If the dough is too wet, you can add a couple of tablespoons of extra flour so it's easier to handle. But keep in mind that a dry dough won't get as stretchy and light as a wetter dough.<br></p>
<p>Step 4 :<br>Form the dough into a loose ball, drizzle a little olive oil on top, and cover the bowl with a clean dish towel. Let the dough rise for 1-2 hours.<br></p>
<p>Step 5 :<br>When the first rise is finished, punch down the dough (deflate it with your fists) and cut the ball in half. Roll each piece of dough into a new ball, place them in separate bowls, and let them rise for another 30 minutes.<br></p>
<p>Step 6 :<br>Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 425 F and prepare your toppings. Mix the sauce ingredients together and set aside, chop any veggies you plan to add, and grate your cheese into piles.<br></p>
<p>Step 7 :<br>Sprinkle a few tablespoons of whole wheat flour on a clean counter top, then flatten one of the dough balls onto it. Use a rolling pin (a glass bottle works in a pinch) to gently roll the dough into a circle (if you're using a pizza stone) or an oval (if you're using a baking sheet.) Use your fingers to shape the edges into a slight crust. You can also lift up the dough by the crusts and gently turn it to help the dough stretch evenly.<br></p>
<p>Step 8 :<br>Once the dough is shaped into a crust, place it on the stone or baking sheet.<br></p>
<p>Step 9 :<br>Rub about 2 teaspoons of olive oil onto the surface of the crust, then add your desired toppings.<br></p>
<p>Step 10 :<br>Bake for 10-12 minutes or until crust is brown, and cheese is bubbling.<br></p>
<p>Step 11 :<br>Slice and serve hot! Repeat the process with your second ball of dough. OR refrigerate or freeze the reamining dough for later.<br></p>
